# Google Business Profile Setup Guide for Agencies/SEO Managers

## 1. Account Strategy: One Account for All?

**Yes, you should use your existing Google Account.**

You **do not** need a separate Google account for every business you manage. Google Business Profile is designed to allow one "Manager" account to oversee multiple business locations.

### The "Agency" Structure (Recommended for you)

Since you want to manage multiple websites/businesses for customers for SEO:

1.  **Use your main professional Google Account.**
2.  **Create "Location Groups" (formerly Business Groups):**
    - This features allows you to group locations (e.g., "My SEO Clients").
    - You can grant access to your team or the business owners specifically for that group or individual location.

## 2. Setting up "Suksan Massage"

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1.  **Log in** to your Google Account at [business.google.com](https://business.google.com/).
2.  Click **Manage now** or **Add business**.
3.  **Enter the Business Name**: Type "Suksan Massage".
    - _Note: If it doesn't appear in the dropdown, click "Create a business with this name"._
4.  **Choose Business Type**: Select **Service business** (if you visit customers) or **Local store** (since you have a physical location at Weingartstrasse 57). **Local store** is best for a massage studio so people can find you on Maps.
5.  **Enter Business Category**: "Thai Massage Therapist" or "Massage Spa".
6.  **Enter Address**:
    - Street: Weingartstrasse 57
    - City: Bern
    - Postal Code: 3014
    - _Important: Ensure this matches your website Imprint exactly._
7.  **Contact Details**:
    - Phone: +41 76 259 05 33
    - Website: https://www.suksan-massage.com
8.  **Verification**: Google will ask to verify the business.
    - **Postcard**: Most common. They mail a code to the address (takes 5-14 days).
    - **Phone/Video**: Sometimes available if you are lucky.

## 3. Managing Multiple Businesses (SEO Optimization)

As you add more customers, follow this workflow to keep things organized and professional:

1.  **Do NOT claim the business yourself if it already exists.**
    - Ask the client to **invite you as a Manager** to their existing profile.
2.  **If creating a new profile for a client:**
    - Create it using your account as described above.
    - Once verified, **make the business owner a "Primary Owner"** and keep yourself as "Manager".
    - This protects you (liability) and them (ownership data), while giving you full access for SEO (posts, photos, updates, responding to reviews).

### Key SEO Actions for Suksan Massage (Once Verified)

- **Complete the Profile**: Add hours, specific services (Thai, Oil, etc.), and the "Book Online" link pointing to your contact form.
- **Photos**: Upload high-quality photos of the studio (Weingartstrasse) and the team.
- **Posts**: Use the "Updates" feature to post about your Opening Promotions or new services (just like a mini-blog enty on Google Maps).
- **Reviews**: The most critical SEO factor. Ask your first few happy customers to leave a 5-star review specifically mentioning keywords like "Thai Massage" or "Back Pain".

## 4. Next Steps

Go to [business.google.com](https://business.google.com/) now and start the process for Suksan Massage. You will likely need to wait for the postcard to arrive at Weingartstrasse 57 to finalize the verification.
