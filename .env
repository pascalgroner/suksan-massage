# 1. OPTION A: SMTP Configuration (Recommended for Vercel/Netlify)
# Use this if you have an external SMTP service (Gmail, SendGrid, your hosting's mail)
SMTP_HOST=smtp.example.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-email@example.com
SMTP_PASS=your-email-password

# 2. OPTION B: Direct MX Delivery (Fallback)
# If SMTP_HOST is left empty, the system will attempt to send directly to the recipient's MX record.
# WARNING: This typically fails on cloud hosting (Vercel/Netlify) due to Port 25 blocking.

# 3. SMS Gateway Configuration
# The email address provided by your SMS provider (e.g., mailsms.ch)
# Example formatting: 0791234567@mailsms.ch
MAIL2SMS_ADDRESS=your-number@mailsms.ch
